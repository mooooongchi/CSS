They are a family of white, round fairy tale characters with large snouts that make them resemble hippopotamuses. The carefree and adventurous family live in their house in Moominvalley, though in the past, their temporary residences have included a lighthouse and a theatre. They have had many adventures along with their various friends.</p>

    <p>In all, nine books were released in the series, together with five picture books and a comic strip being released between 1945 and 1993.</p>

    <p>The Moomins have since been the basis for numerous television series, films and even a theme park called Moomin World in Naantali, Finland.</p>
